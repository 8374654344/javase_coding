`Comparator` and `Comparable` are two interfaces in Java used for sorting objects, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:

1. **Comparable**:
   - The `Comparable` interface is implemented by a class to specify its natural ordering.
   - When a class implements `Comparable`, it provides a way to compare instances of that class.
   - The `compareTo` method is defined in the `Comparable` interface, and it's used to compare the current object with another object of the same class.
   - Objects that implement `Comparable` can be sorted using methods like `Collections.sort()` or `Arrays.sort()` without specifying an external comparator.

   Example of a class implementing `Comparable`:
   ```java
   public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
       private int id;
       private String name;

       // Constructor, getters, setters, and other methods...

       @Override
       public int compareTo(Student other) {
           return Integer.compare(this.id, other.id);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Comparator**:
   - The `Comparator` interface is used to define custom comparison logic for sorting when you don't have control over the class whose objects you want to sort.
   - It allows you to compare objects based on criteria that might not be the natural ordering of the class.
   - You can create multiple `Comparator` implementations for the same class to enable sorting in different ways.

   Example of using a `Comparator`:
   ```java
   List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
   // Add students to the list...

   // Sort students by name using a Comparator
   students.sort(Comparator.comparing(Student::getName));

   // Sort students by ID using a different Comparator
   students.sort(Comparator.comparing(Student::getId));
   ```

In summary, `Comparable` is typically used when you want to define a default or natural ordering for a class, whereas 
`Comparator` is used when you need to provide custom sorting criteria for a class, especially when you can't modify the class itself.
You can use both interfaces in combination to achieve different sorting behaviors for the same class.
